RespoNexa 🤖
Welcome to RespoNexa, a fun and interactive chatbot designed to make conversations more engaging! Created by Sourabh Jha, RespoNexa showcases the basics of building a chatbot that can handle simple conversations and respond dynamically based on user input.

Features ✨
Greetings: Say hello and get a personalized response.
Goodbyes: Properly say farewell with a friendly message.
Gratitude: Responds to thanks with a warm acknowledgment.
Mood Responses: Engages with phrases like "I'm bored" or "I'm sad".
Humor: Lightens up the chat with jokes from an online API.
Custom Responses: Handles specific phrases like "ping", "ok boomer", and more.

How It Works 🛠️
The chatbot utilizes a dictionary of triggers and responses to simulate conversation. When you input a phrase, RespoNexa checks against its database and responds accordingly. If the input doesn't match any predefined triggers, it sends a default message.

The bot is designed to:
Feel Real: With a slight delay in responses to mimic human conversation.
Be Random: Uses random selection for responses to keep the interaction fresh.

Future Improvements 🚀
Expanded Vocabulary: Adding more triggers and responses.
Enhanced Conversation Flow: Making interactions more natural and engaging.
Learning Capabilities: Implementing machine learning to improve over time.
